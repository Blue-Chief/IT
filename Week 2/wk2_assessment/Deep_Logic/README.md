### **Task 3: The "Deep-Logic" Loan Qualifier**

**Focus:** Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and Comparison.

**The Scenario:** You are building the backend for a FinTech app. A user only qualifies for a loan under specific, tricky conditions.

- **The Input:** Ask for `Age`, `Credit Score`, and `Monthly Income`.
- **The Logic:** A user is `is_qualified` **ONLY IF**:
  1. They are at least 21 years old.
  2. **AND** they have a credit score above 700.
  3. **OR** they have a credit score above 600 **AND** an income over $5,000.
  4. **AND NOT** if their income is less than $1,500 (regardless of score).
- **The Goal:** The interns must write this entire logic in **one single line** of code using parentheses and logical operators.
- **Output:** `Loan Qualification Status: True/False`.
