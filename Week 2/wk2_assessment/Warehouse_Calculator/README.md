### **Task 2: The Warehouse "Case & Remainder" Calculator**

**Focus:** Arithmetic Operators (Floor Division/Modulo) and Assignment Operators.

**The Scenario:** Our warehouse needs to ship units in large crates (12 units) and small boxes (4 units).

- **The Input:** Ask the user for the total number of units to ship.
- **The Logic:**
  1. Use `//` to find how many full crates are needed.
  2. Use `%` to find the units left over after crates.
  3. Use `//` again to see how many small boxes fit the remainder.
  4. Anything left after that is "Individual Loose Items."
- **The Assignment:** Use an **Assignment Operator** (e.g., `total_cost += ...`) to calculate shipping fees: $50 per crate, $20 per box, and $5 per loose item.
- **Output:** Print the breakdown: `Crates: X, Boxes: Y, Loose: Z. Total Cost: $ABC`.
