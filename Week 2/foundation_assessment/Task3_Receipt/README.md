## **Task 3: Automated Office Service Receipt**

**File Name:** `task3_receipt.py`

**The Scenario:** You are building a CLI tool for the front desk to bill clients for refreshments and parking.

**Requirements:**

1. **User Inputs:**
   - Number of guests (e.g., `6`).
   - Cost per refreshment (e.g., `12.50`).
   - Arrival Time and Departure Time (Use 24-hour format: `HH:MM`).
2. **The Logic:**
   - **Refreshment Subtotal:** `Guests * Price`.
   - **Bulk Discount:** If guests > 5, apply a 10% discount to the refreshment subtotal.
   - **Parking Fee:** Parking costs **₦5.00 per hour**. You must charge for a full hour even if they stay for a fraction of an hour (e.g., 1 hour and 10 minutes = 2 hours charged).
3. **The Brain-Tasker (Formatting):**
   - Generate a "Receipt" in the terminal.
   - You must use **string alignment** (`<`, `>`, or `^`) to ensure that all prices align vertically, regardless of the length of the label.
   - Apply a final 7.5% Service Tax to the grand total.

**Example Output Style:**

Plaintext

```
